'''
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

# Solution-1
'''
Algorithm:
    1. consider first index value as buy price to start with and max_profit = 0
    2. loop prices list and find max(max_profit, price - buy) and if price < buy, update buy with new price

Time complexity = O(N)
Space complexity = O(1)

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        buy = prices[0]
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            max_profit = max(max_profit, prices[i] - buy)
            buy = min(buy, prices[i])
        return max_profit
